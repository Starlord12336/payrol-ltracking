59.0 | The system must generate gross-to-net breakdown reports for employees and management to validate calculations.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Row 176:
63.0 | Any payroll initiation or modification (automatic or manual) must go through validation checks (e.g., contract active, no expired approvals, minimum wage compliance) before processing.

● Leaves Module: for cases of unapproved leaves, or for encashment of unused annual leave balance for termination. Such unused leaves must be either carried forward to the next fiscal year (if allowed) or converted into compensation, in line with Egyptian Labor Law 2025. Also, to factor in paid and unpaid leave deductions automatically applied based on leave rules. 
● Time Management: to factor in working days/hours, overtime, and absence data directly.
